## What does this app do?

This app uses `homey-oauth2app` to control Nuki devices using the Nuki API. Read more about creating an OAuth 2.0 app at https://apps.developer.homey.app/cloud/oauth2.

Please note that your Nuki Smart Lock must be first connected to Nuki Web before it can be found by Homey.
